# Introduction

**Warcraft-GQL** is a graphql API for World of Warcraft and inspired by **[narutoql](https://narutoql.com/)**. You can use this API to get data that was not available in the official Blizzard API, such as Class and Race info as seen **[here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/races/human)**. This project started as a way to tinker with some new libraries and framework, so feel free to contribute and add to the schema.
